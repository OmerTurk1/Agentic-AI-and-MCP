Elif loved waking up with the first rays of the sun in the morning. She always set her alarm for 6:30, watered the little flowers in front of her window, and then prepared a nice breakfast. After breakfast, she usually left for university. On her way, she never forgot to listen to music and watch the scenery out the window.

After her classes ended, she would meet her best friend at the library, chat a bit, and study together. In the evening, when she returned home, she would tidy her room, play with her cat Pamuk, and prepare dinner with her mother. At the end of the day, she would read her favorite book, make herself a cup of tea, and make plans for the next day. For Elif, these small joys were the most precious moments of her life.
